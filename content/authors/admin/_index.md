I am a postdoc at the University of Michigan working with [Karen Smith](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~kesmith/). I recently finished my PhD at the University of Utah, under the guidance of [Karl Schwede](http://www.math.utah.edu/~schwede/). My research focuses on positive-characteristic commutative algebra, including connections with combinatorics, birational geometry, and symbolic powers of ideals.
